    <body> running sod or overview what you have, example XML and tutorials (tutorial, weed, create

                <p>
                    <code>bin/sod.sh -f examples/tutorial.xml</code>
                    <br/>
                    <br/> If you're on a Unix-like OS, use the <tt>bin/sod.sh</tt> script in the bin
                    directory. To run it, execute bin/sod.sh with the arguments <tt>-f <em>strategy_file</em>
                    </tt>. The <tt>-f</tt> option specifies the strategy file SOD uses to set up a
                    run. The command <code>bin/sod.sh -f examples/tutorial.xml</code> runs the same
                    tutorial strategy that the editor opens by default.</p>

                <p>
                    <code>bin\sod.bat -f examples\tutorial.xml</code>
                    <br/>
                    <br/> SOD runs are started with a <tt>.bat</tt> file in Windows. To execute it,
                    open a command window execute <tt>bin\sod.bat</tt> with the arguments <tt>-f <em>strategy_file</em>
                    </tt>. This will start SOD using the strategy file specified after the -f flag.
                    The command <tt>bin\sod.bat -f examples/tutorial.xml</tt> runs the same tutorial
                    strategy that the editor opens by default.</p>

        <section name="Figuring out what SOD is doing using HTML status">
            <p>Both weed.xml and tutorial.xml in the SOD distribution generate HTML status pages,
                maps, and images of seismograms as they run. These can be used to monitor the work
                SOD is doing. The files are all put in the directory specified by the property
                Status Base Directory. The default is the directory <tt>status</tt> relative to
                wherever the SOD run is started. So, if you start a SOD run on tutorial.xml as
                described in the first section of this document, a status directory will be created
                inside of the sod directory. This directory will contain loads of html files
                describing what SOD is doing. The best to visit first is index.html. It contains
                some basic information about the run (when it was started, how many waveforms have
                been processed, etc) and has links to all of the other pages SOD is generating. To
                find out more about what SOD is doing, follow those links and click on the <img
                src="helpmark.png"/> icons to see what the data near them indicates. </p>

        <section name="Cleaning up after SOD">
            <img class="right" src="images/half-sodlogo-y100.gif"/>
            <section name="Generated files">
                <p>SOD runs generate a ton of files, and if those files still exist for subsequent
                    runs it can cause problems. For example the save seismogram to file waveform arm
                    processor will not write over the files of a previous run. If it wants to write
                    to a file already exists, it'll just write that file but with an incrementing
                    number appended to the end. So if similar SOD runs are executed in the same
                    directory, they'll probably end up writing out files to the same place with
                    bigger and bigger numbers appended to the end. These are less than desirable
                    results. As such, you should either delete the data directories between
                    subsequent runs, or run SOD in different directories per run as described in the
                    section about running in a directory other than the install. tutorial.xml and
                    weed.xml both generate SAC files and save them to the POND_II directory. So, if
                    you run one of them, tweak it, and then want to run it again in the same
                    directory, delete the POND_II directory before starting the run.</p>

            <section name="SOD's Database">
                <p>SOD uses a database internally to store information about what events and
                    networks it's gotten, the pairings of events and channels it has processed, and
                    the results of various processes. If SOD suddenly stops due to events outside of
                    its control (power outage, operating system reboot, 10.5 is on and SOD doesn't
                    want to miss it) it can use this database to pick up where it left off and keep
                    truckin'. However, if you start SOD and its database is sitting there from a
                    previous completed run, it'll just think it died unexpectedly and check its
                    database to see what work remains. If the config file gets the same events and
                    channels, SOD will declare all work finished and quit immediately. To remedy
                    this, there is a property called Remove Database set in both weed.xml and
                    tutorial.xml that tells SOD to wipe its database before starting up. As long as
                    this is set, SOD starts with a clean slate. However, if the unexpected has
                    happened (nuclear holocaust, T-Rex attack, sale on attractive garnet tractors)
                    and SOD is interrupted, unset this property so SOD will continue where it left
                    off. You can unset it by either changing TRUE inside the removeDatabase tag to
                    FALSE, or unchecking the Remove Database option in the editor and saving the file.</p>
