                <section name="Installing SOD">
                        <p> SOD is currently distributed in tar and zip formats. Both contain the
                                same content, but we want to keep everyone happy. After <a
                                href="download.html">downloading</a> the most recent version of the
                                zip or the tar, whichever you please, unpack it with the tool of
                                your choice. This will unpack something in a directory structure
                                like the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                                <li>SOD <ul>
                                                <li>bin</li>
                                                <li>lib</li>
                                                <li>docs</li>
                                        </ul>
                                </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> At this point if all of these things came out of the distribution, SOD is officiallly installed. If you're not too worn out
                                by the heavy lifting involved in unpacking SOD, now might be a good
                                time to go on to the <a href="walkthrough.html">walkthrough</a> to
                                see various neat things SOD can do. </p>
