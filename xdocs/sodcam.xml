            <p> If you are curious to see what the output of a SOD run looks like without all the
                danger of running it locally, have a look at our <a
                href="http://www.seis.sc.edu/SODcam/status">SOD-cam</a>, which shows the results of
                a SOD run at USC that collects seismograms for events in near real time. The SODcam
                is long running, so check back as new earthquakes occur.</p>
