        <section name="What is XML">
            <p>XML stands for the eXtensible Markup Language. It's a textual format that structures
                data. It was designed by the W3C. You can see their information about XML <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">here</a>.</p>
        </section>
        <section name="How does SOD use XML?">
            <p>SOD's strategy files are stored in XML. The textual format of XML means that they're
                editable by text editors like vi, emacs or even Notepad on Windows. </p>
        </section>
        <section name="What do I need to know about XML to use SOD?">
            <p>Nothing for basic usage. You can use SOD's GUI editor to change settings in the
                tutorial strategy files distributed with SOD. To actually change the tactics SOD
                uses though, you'll need to edit the strategy files in a text editor. To do this,
                it's best to have some understanding of the structure of XML so that you understand
                what you're editing, and you understand what the error messages mean if something
                goes wrong. SOD only uses a subset of XML in its builtin processors and subsetters.
                There are no attributes, namespaces, and other more arcane features of XML in
                SOD(though you're certainly welcome to use these features in your external
                processors if you like). If you read through the first six examples <a
                href="http://www.zvon.org/xxl/XMLTutorial/Output/example1.html">here</a> you should
                know enough about XML to understand the structure SOD strategy files.</p>
