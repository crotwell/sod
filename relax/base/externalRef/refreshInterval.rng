                    <description>The network arm will go out and check all of the information its
                        gotten at the period defined here. This allows for new networks and stations
                        to be found midrun and then be processed for the rest of the time SOD runs.
                        So if you have a run on networks that have new stations being added, setting
                        this value will allow for those new stations to be processed by your run.</description>
