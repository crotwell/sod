                <description> The event arm gathers events from the server specified in the event
                    finder. If there are any origin subsetters present, the event arm then runs
                    those over the events returned by the finder. The events that pass through the
                    subsetters are then run through any event processors present. After this point,
                    the events are marked as accepted and the waveform arm begins to work on them.
                    If there are any event status items present, they generate status information
                    about the events as they step through the process described above. </description>
