                <description>Both types of waveform arm take the items returned by the network and
                    event arms and generate the necessary requests to retrieve seismograms. The data
                    received are then processed. The regular waveformArm takes each channel from the
                    network arm and runs it through its subsetters and processors individually. The
                    waveformVectorArm takes the channels from the network arm, groups them as
                    motion vectors, and runs them through its items as a group.</description>
