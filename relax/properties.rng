                <description>Rather than asking for events over the entire period in the event arm
                    at once, SOD breaks all of the event work up into smaller pieces. This allows
                    SOD to begin processing data for the first events in a run without having to
                    wait for the retrieval of all of the events. The value of this property
                    determines the size of the pieces. The piece size should be large enough so that
                    an event is returned for every query, but not so large that an overwhelming
                    number of events is returned each time. The default value is 7 days, and this
                    should be fine for most runs.</description>

                <description>When SOD has an event arm with times spanning into the future, this
                    value determines how long it waits between queries to see if there are any new
                    events. Rather than continually making requests to the event server, this allows
                    some request throttling as a courtesy to other users of the server. The default
                    value is 6 minutes, but can be made higher if the run doesn't need events the
                    minute the arrive at the server.</description>

                <description>SOD will continue to ask for new events from the event server for the
                    amount of time specified here after the end date in the event arm query. This
                    exists so runs that are close to real time may continue to see if events come in
                    for the times they're interested in after that time. For runs in the past, this
                    value will have no effect unless adding it to the event arm's end date pushes it
                    past the time the run ends.  The default value is one week.</description>

                <description>If a SOD run is stopped while running, the event channel groups it's
                    working on are left in an indeterminate state in the database. SOD knows it
                    started working on them, but it doesn't know how far it progressed when SOD
                    died. This property tells SOD how to deal with these indeterminate items. If
                    "atLeastOnce" is used, SOD will take the indeterminate items, set them to new,
                    and process them. This means that no matter what happens to a SOD run, the items
                    will get processed through the entire set of waveform arm processors. It also
                    might mean that some processors get run a second time on the items, so if a
                    processor expects to see everything only once, use the second value,
                    "atMostOnce". This tells SOD to switch all of the indeterminate items over to
                    the failed state and ignore them from now on. SOD defaults to atLeastOnce</description>
