				<p>
					If the built-in subsetters and processors in SOD don't meet your particular needs, external processors
					may be the answer.  They allow you to write Java code that hooks into a SOD recipe at any 
					step with the same information and ability of the built-in code.  Writing an external processor
					requires some additional skills beyond those needed by a regular SOD user.  Your life will be much easier 
					if you've written and compiled Java code before.  
					</p>
					<p>
					The <a href="tutorial.html">externals tutorial</a>
					covers creating a simple external origin subsetter
					from soup to nuts.  You should start there to get an idea of how a processor is constructed.
					
					After going through the tutorial, check the various <a href="types.html">types of externals</a> to
					see which one fits the bill for your needs. 
					</p>
					<p class="reallyshort">
					If you run into some snags or need a starting direction for your own external processor
                   please contact the #EnkodeEmail("sod" "SOD Mailing List") for help.
