            <p>Any amount of text can go here. The only restriction is that you must escape the
                characters XML uses. So if you want to use &lt; you must write it like
                &amp;lt; and if you want to use &amp; you need to use &amp;amp; so that
                it SOD doesn't think you're adding more tags, but other than that, anything goes. </p>
