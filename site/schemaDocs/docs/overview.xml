        <section name="Welcome to the SOD Ingredient Reference!">
            <p>The ingredient reference contains a page for every ingredient that can go into SOD. If you
                want to extend and improve your SOD runs, it's the place to find pieces of SOD that
                do what you want.</p>
        </section>
        <section name="What is an Ingredient?">
            <p>A ingredient is a single operation in SOD. A SOD recipe file consists of multiple
                ingredients that tell SOD how to gather and process data.</p>
        </section>
        <section name="What's in each ingredient's page?">
            <p> Each ingredient's page consists of four major sections: a description of the ingredient's
                uses, an example of the ingredient's structure, an abstract description of the ingredient's
                structure, and a list of all of the ingredients that contain this ingredient. </p>
            <section name="Description">
                <p> Each page starts with the name of the ingredient followed by its description. The
                    description contains a general idea of what the ingredient does, common usages, and
                    references to other ingredients that use this one.</p>
            </section>
            <section name="Example">
                <p>The example shows what an instance of this ingredient looks like. You can copy the
                    example, paste it in the correct place in a recipe file, and SOD will start
                    using it. It can help to see a base usage of a ingredient to modify it for your own purposes.</p>
            </section>
            <section name="This consists of">
                <p>This section describes the exact structure of the current ingredient. It's important
                    enough to get its own page explaining it <a href="abstractStructure.html">here</a>.</p>
            </section>
            <section name="Places this can be found">
                <p> This section lists every ingredient that contains this ingredient. In the case where
                    this is contained in a choice, the items that can be substituted for this are
                    listed as well. </p>
            </section>
        </section>
        <section name="How do I find the Ingredient I want?">
            <p>So you've got a SOD recipe file that does most of what you want, but you need to
                refine the data or add another processing step. How do you find the right ingredient to
                insert to get the work done? The menu that runs down the left side of all of the
                Ingredient Reference pages consists of links to each of the ingredient pages for the major
                steps in SOD's operations broken down by arm. If you can identify the step that
                needs to be refined, just select that one out of the menu and find the appropriate
                ingredient. Lets say the events SOD returns past a certain distance aren't worth
                processing. Since the problem is solely with the events, that means the event arm
                needs to be tweaked. After clicking on Origin in the eventArm section of the menu,
                scanning the various pieces that can go there reveals originPointDistance. By adding
                an originPointDistance with a small max distance value to the eventArm keeps SOD
                from processing events that are far away.</p>
