        <section name="The 'This Consists Of' Section of the Tactic Reference">
            <p>When SOD starts up, your strategy file is checked to make sure it will work. Only certain items are
                allowed in certain places, so you have to be careful when creating or editing a strategy file.</p>
            <p>The 'This Consists Of' section of the Tactic Reference describes what should go where. We explain what
                the pieces are in terms of XML. If you don't know anything about XML, we recommend that you read our <a
                href="../xmlIntro.html">introduction</a> before reading this page any further.</p>
        </section>
        <section name="A Basic Example">
            <p>This the 'This consists of' section of the <a href="event/origin/originPointDistance.html">origin point
                distance</a> tactic.</p>
            <div id="contained">

                </p>
            </div>
            <section name="The containing originPointDistance tag">
                <p>The first line shows the start tag &lt;originPointDistance&gt; . This means that at this
                    point in the strategy file (ie every place in the 'Places containing this' section) the element
                    originPointDistance along with its contents are acceptable.</p>
                <p>The next three lines along the black line must appear inside the originPointDistance element since
                    they are directly below and indented from it. The black line indicates they are grouped together and
                    must appear in the order they are given going down the page.</p>
            </section>
            <section name="The latitude and longitude elements">
                <p>The latitude element must be the first thing inside of the originPointDistance element. A latitude
                    only contains one thing: a 'double'. Text without brackets in bold indicates a single piece of data.
                    Anything that matches a generic datatype is acceptable here, and clicking on its link will take you
                    to a description of the datatype. Since this is a 'double', pretty much any numeric value can be given.</p>
                <p>After the latitude element and its 'double' contents, the very similar longitude element must be
                    added to originPointDistance. It is just another element with a 'double' value inside of it.</p>
            </section>
            <section name="Generic range definition">
                <p> Finally, there is a link to 'range'. A simple link without any brackets should be replaced with the
                    contents of its 'This consists of' section. To see what must go in the place of the range link,
                    click on it to get to its page. It consists of a unit, min, and max element.</p>
                <p>The unit element links to a deeper page that shows that it must be a complete unit element with the
                    name of a unit of distance inside of it. As such, putting one of the values like KILOMETER or MILE
                    satisfies this condition.</p>
                <p>The min and max elements are very similar to the latitude and longitude elements defined earlier.
                    They are just simple elements with doubles inside of them.</p>
                <p>For this particular example, then, the range link in originPointDistance should be replaced with a
                    unit element, a min element, and a max element.</p>
            </section>
            <section name="Putting it all together">
                <p>Combining the results of the previous section, originPointDistance consists of an originPointDistance
                    tag with latitude, longitude, unit, min and max tags inside of it:</p>
                <pre>&lt;originPointDistance&gt; &lt;latitude&gt;35&lt;/latitude&gt;
                    &lt;longitude&gt;-85&lt;/longitude&gt;
                    &lt;unit&gt;DEGREE&lt;/unit&gt; &lt;min&gt;30&lt;/min&gt;
                    &lt;max&gt;90&lt;/max&gt; &lt;/originPointDistance&gt;</pre>

            <section name="Labels">
                <p>Compared to the last example, this one is a bit larger. It also has labels beside or surrounding
                    certain tags to tell tell whats allowed and how many times. In particular, this example introduces
                    the concepts of 'choice', 'optional', and 'Any number of times'. Both examples so far have used a 'group'.</p>
            </section>
            <section name="group">
                <p>A group is denoted by a solid vertical line. The concept of a group is simple, and we already
                    followed it without naming it in the previous example. Tags in a group must appear in the order they
                    are specified in the 'This consists of' section. This means that inside the eventFinder the name
                    always comes first, then dns and so on down the line of the group.</p>
            </section>
            <section name="choice">
                <p>Choices are denoted by a dashed vertical line. Within a choice, you can use one of the items it
                    contains. For this particular example, you have the choice between globalArea and boxArea. Also, if
                    you follow the name and dns links, you will see that they also have choices for the values you may enter.</p>
            </section>
            <section name="optional">
                <p>Any tag or choice that is labeled as 'optional' can be included either once or not at all. For this
                    example, you don't have to have an originDepthRange or a magnitudeRange if you don't need to use
                    one. Since they are both in the group we talked about earlier, they must be included in the right
                    order if they are included. If they are left out, you just skip to the next item in the group.</p>
            </section>
            <section name="Any number of times">
                <p>Anything labeled as 'Any number of times' is optional, but can be included more than once. In this
                    example, you can have one catalog tag, 20 catalog tags, absolutely no catalog tags, or however many
                    catalog tags you wish.</p>

                <p>These last two examples illustrate a couple of other important concepts you need to know before you

                    whether or not the unit tag comes first. Both of the following xml snippets are acceptable.</p>

                    example, requestOR must have at least one request. It cannot be empty, but it can have one, two,
                    twenty, or an infinite amount of requests.</p>
